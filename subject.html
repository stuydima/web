    <h1>The Process and Journey of Making Graphics</h1>
    <p>
      I have been making graphics for a certain company for almost a year now.
      The process itself is rather painstaking and time-consuming, but it in
      itself is quite entertaining and occupies me with something to do. I use
      Adobe Photoshop to make the graphics.

      <li>Gathering Data</li>
      <li>Formulating Ideas</li>
      <li>Bringing to Fruition</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Gathering Data</h2>
    <p>
      I always start off by gathering data from a request made by someone who
      requires a graphic for whatever purpose. They provide me with an idea and
      (optionally) instructions for what I should do. Usually I'm just given a
      prompt and I have to determine what to do with it myself. What helps me is
      looking at my past creations in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop" target="blank"
        >Photoshop</a
      >
      and getting inspiration from there. It helps me preserve a consistent
      graphical style.
    </p>
    <h2>Formulating Ideas</h2>
    <p>
      This is where the creativity part comes in: I have to determine what to do
      with the prompt I'm given.

        target="blank"
        >The only limit is your imagination</a
      >, so usually I make a few concepts up in my head and then work from there
      in Photoshop .
    </p>
    <h2>Bringing to Fruition</h2>
    <p>
      This is often the trickiest part; it takes lots of patience which I lack.
      It's also where skill is most utilized so it often takes me several tries
      for what I'm making to resemble what I'm seeing in my head as an image.
      Photoshop's interface was not very tricky to figure out, so it mostly
      comes down to what I can do with the
