    <h1>Gathering Data</h1>
    <p>
      I always start off by gathering data from a request made by someone who
      requires a graphic for whatever purpose. They provide me with an idea and
      (optionally) instructions for what I should do. Usually I'm just given a
      prompt and I have to determine what to do with it myself. What helps me is
      looking at my past creations in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop" target="blank"
        >Photoshop</a
      >
      and getting inspiration from there. It helps me preserve a consistent
      graphical style.
