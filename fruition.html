      This is often the trickiest part; it takes lots of patience... which I lack. It's also where skill is most utilized so it often takes me several
      tries for what I'm making to resemble what I'm seeing in my head as an image. Photoshop's interface was not very tricky to figure out, so it
      mostly comes down to what I can do with the

      "Several tries" may have been an understatement. What seems to occupy little time may actually have taken several hours over the course of
      several days; such was the case with the graphic below. I was unable to handle this horseshoe and thus had to take long breaks before coming
      back with a refreshed mind and rinsing and repeating (The final result's file name is actually "TerraWild4.1.png" due to the fact that it took
      me over 4 complete tries to get the horseshoe shape/design and coloring that was in my head into the program).
